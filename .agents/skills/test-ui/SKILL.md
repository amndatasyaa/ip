# Test UI

Use [`test/ui-test-plan.md`](../../../test/ui-test-plan.md) as the source of truth. Each test case must contain an aim, a fenced `Input` block containing the commands sent to the program, and a fenced `Expected output` block containing the complete expected console output.

When the user supplies new test cases, record or update them in the test plan before running them. Preserve exact spaces, punctuation, and line breaks because the comparison is exact.

Run all cases from the repository root:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/test-ui/scripts/run_ui_tests.py
```

The runner compiles with Java 25, starts a fresh program for each test case, and prints the case aim plus the complete console input and actual output. If a comparison fails, stop immediately and report the expected and actual outputs printed by the runner. Do not continue to later cases after a failure.
